## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Sergio

As a Full Stack Developer specializing in JavaScript, I'm passionate about using my skills to build user-friendly, highly effective applications. I mainly work with technologies like Node.js, Express.js, React.js and MongoDB. I love solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and bringing ideas to life with code.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on carbon system projects. There is a project using Node.js, Express.js to build an API for handling products, providers, customers. There is also a React UI dashboard for showing various analytics dashboards and products.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to do singing and dancing in my free time.
